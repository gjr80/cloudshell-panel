# CPU temperature display settings.
#

# Many Linux variants make CPU (and other) temperature available by reading a
# file object. The XU4 makes temperature available in
# /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp, /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone1/temp,
# /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/temp, /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone3/temp
# and /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone4/temp.
# File like object to be used for displaying CPU temperature. String, default
# /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp.
cpu_temp_location = '/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp'

# The CPU temperature display colour can be changed depending on temperature.
# Three temperature bands are supported and these are defined by cpu_temp1 and
# cpu_temp2. CPU temperatures below cpu_temp1 are displayed in the colour set
# by cpu_temp_normal, CPU temperatures >= cpu_temp1 and <cpu_temp2 are
# displayed in the colour set by cpu_temp_colour1. CPU temperatures >=cpu_temp2
# are displayed in the colour set by cpu_temp_colour2.

# Colour used for CPU temperature < cpu_temp1. String, default is light green.
cpu_temp_colour_normal = light green

# Temperature in C above which CPU temperature is displayed using cpu_temp_colour1.
# Number, default 80.
cpu_temp1 = 80

# Colour used for CPU temperature >= cpu_temp1 and < cpu_temp2. String, default
# is light yellow.

# Temperature in C above which CPU temperature is displayed using cpu_temp_colour2.

#
# Mounted hard disk display settings
#

# The hdd_display option is used to determine which mounted devices (maximum 3)
# will be displayed on the Cloudshell2 LCD. The hdd_display option is a comma
# separated list of strings. Only devices that match one or more of the
# hdd_display option list items may be displayed. If a hdd_display list item
# ends with an asterisk then a wild card search is conducted against all device
# names using the characters preceding the asterisk. Otherwise the hdd_display
# list items specify exact device name matches.
# For example:
#   hdd_display = /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2 would match /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 but
#                 not /dev/sda3
#   hdd_display = /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb* would match /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1 but
#                 not /dev/sda2
#   hdd_display = /dev/sda1* would match /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda11 but not
#                 /dev/sda2 or /dev/sdb1
# If more than 3 devices are identified for display then only the first 3 are
# displayed.
hdd_display = /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, /dev/sda3

# The hard disk usage display colour can be changed depending on the percentage
# level of disk usage. Three bands are supported and these are defined by
# hdd_usage1 and hdd_usage2. Disk usage below hdd_usage1 are displayed in the
# colour set by hdd_usage_colour_normal, hard disk usage >= hdd_usage1 and
# < hdd_usage2 are displayed in the colour set by hdd_usage_colour1. Hard disk
# usage >= hdd_usage2 is displayed in the colour set by hdd_usage_colour2.

# Colour used for hard disk usage < hdd_usage1. String, default is light green.
hdd_usage_colour_normal = light green

# Hard disk usage in % above which hard disk usage is displayed using
# hdd_usage_colour1. Number, default 75.
hdd_usage1 = 75

# Colour used for hard disk usage >= hdd_usage1 and < hdd_usage2. String, default
# is light yellow.
hdd_usage_colour1 = light yellow

# Hard disk usage in % above which hard disk usage is displayed using
# hdd_usage_colour2. Number, default 90.
hdd_usage2 = 90

# Colour used for hard disk usage >= hdd_usage2. String, default is light red.
